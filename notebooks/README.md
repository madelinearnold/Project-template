Supplementary Notebooks
================

Store notebooks here that contain in-progress code or supplementary code
not critical to the main analysis performed in the main project
notebook. May be useful to have separate notebooks for data import, data
exploration, data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

After pieces of more finalized code are completed they should be moved
to the main notebook.
