Notebooks
================

Store notebooks here that contain your analyses and textual commentary. 

Start by adding analyses to Main-notebook.Rmd.

Additional notebooks can be added for in-progress code or supplementary analyses not critical to the main analysis performed in the main project
notebook. May be useful to have separate notebooks for data import, data
exploration, data analysis, modeling, and visualization for larger projects.
